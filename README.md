*Experiences with 100Gbps network applications*
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2287004

100Gbps networking has finally arrived, and many research and educational institutions have begun to deploy 100Gbps routers and services. ESnet and Internet2 worked together to make 100Gbps networks available to researchers at the Supercomputing 2011 conference in Seattle Washington. In this paper, we describe two of the first applications to take advantage of this network. We demonstrate a visualization application that enables remotely located scientists to gain insights from large datasets. We also demonstrate climate data movement and analysis over the 100Gbps network. We describe a number of application design issues and host tuning strategies necessary for enabling applications to scale to 100Gbps rates.
